4. Use Parallel Structure
Keep headings grammatically consistent.
Example: If using verbs, stick to verbs for all headings.
 Good Example: (All action-oriented)
 Setting Up Your Account
 Managing User Permissions
 Troubleshooting Login Issues

 Bad Example: (Inconsistent structure)
 Setting Up Your Account
 User Permissions Management
 How to Troubleshoot Login Problems

5. Make Headings Descriptive, Not Generic
Avoid one-word headings like Introduction or Details—they lack context.
Instead, give the reader useful information.
 Good Example:
 Why Two-Factor Authentication Matters

 Bad Example:
 Security Info

6. Use Keywords for SEO & Searchability
If writing for web or documentation, include keywords to improve search results.
Example: Optimizing Battery Life on an iPhone instead of just Battery Tips.
